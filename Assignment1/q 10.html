    <b><i>The Importance of Exercise</i></b>
    <hr style="width:100%;">
    <p>Regular exercise is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It not only improves physical fitness but also enhances mental well-being. Engaging in activities like running, swimming, or weightlifting helps strengthen muscles, boost cardiovascular health, and maintain a healthy weight. Exercise releases endorphins, also known as "feel-good hormones," which reduce stress and improve mood. Additionally, staying active can prevent chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. By incorporating exercise into daily routines, individuals can enjoy increased energy levels, better sleep, and overall improved quality of life.</p>
